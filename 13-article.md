## Article XIII - Use of Fire Equipment

### Section 1: Equipment Use

No equipment is to be taken from any truck or fire department property without special authorization of the chief or assistant chief. All personal protective equipment (PPE) shall remain at the fire house and maintained when needed. A member living two (2) miles or greater from the fire station has the option to keep personal protective equipment at home, with the approval of the chief. That member is responsible for the care of such equipment and will be required to reimburse the department if any equipment is lost, damaged, or stolen due to neglect of proper storage.

### Section 2: Emergency Vehicles Leaving on Calls

No emergency apparatuses may leave for an emergency call without at least two (2) firefighters in response without the approval of an officer.

### Section 3: Emergency Vehicle Passengers

Only fire fighters, or rescue members, are to ride fire equipment on emergency calls without permission of an officer. During any other situation, permission of the fire chief or assistant chief is required for any non-fire fighter person to ride on or in trucks or other equipment.

### Section 4: Non-Emergency Use of Equipment

Fire equipment may be used for non-emergency purposes, if manned by members of the department on a volunteer basis. This pertains only to our fire district. Prior approval must be given from the chief or assistant chief before fire equipment may be used for such purposes. The chief or assistant chief is responsible to obtain any necessary authorization from the Palmyra Rural Fire District. All equipment will be returned in the same conditions in which it was borrowed.
