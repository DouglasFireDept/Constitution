## Article VIII - Duties of Members

### Section 1: Responding to a Call

Upon hearing the alarm of fire, each member shall go to the fire barn in the least possible time to pick up protective gear for his or her personal use at the fire. It shall be the duty of the persons leaving on the first truck out of the fire barn to make sure that the location of the call and extent, if known, be posted on the blackboard. If the trucks have left, the fire fighter shall join them with as little delay as possible, and use his or her best discretion in the discharge of duties as may be assigned by the officer in command. Should any member refuse to obey the officer in command, that member may be brought before such officer at the next regular meeting, and failing to show just cause for such disobedience, shall be expelled at the discretion of the department. All fire fighters attending an emergency call must receive permission to be dismissed from the officer in charge. Wearing of gear at all fires and auto accidents is required:
1. Helmet with protective hood,
2. Gloves,
3. Coat,
4. Boots,
5. Pants.
There will be no exceptions, everyone will come in full gear.
